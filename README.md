# Selenium C# Automation Test

This code provides a utility for automating browser actions using Selenium WebDriver with C#. It includes a test that validates functionality by interacting with the [LambdaTest Selenium Playground](https://www.lambdatest.com/selenium-playground/simple-form-demo). It can be integrated into any project requiring browser-based testing with Selenium.

## Integration

To integrate the Selenium automation test into your project, follow these steps:

1. Copy the project files into your project's test folder.
2. Import the `SeleniumTests` class where needed.
